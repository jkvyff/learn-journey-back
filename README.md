# Learn Journey Backend
My backend for [Learn-Journey](https://github.com/jkvyff/learn-journey).

I intend to create a model for different types of leaning resources found on the web that can be combined into classes or study guides that can be shared, rated, and ranked for others to find the best way that they can learn a new topic.

## Model
- User
- Resource

## Tech
- Node.js
- Apollo Server
- Express
- GraphQL
- Postgres
- TypeScript
- Puppeteer


Steps to run this project:
